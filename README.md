# UDL_mini_project
This is the code reporsitory for the Uncertainty in Deep Learning mini project.
The code is an extension from https://github.com/NixGD/variational-continual-learning
Based on their implementation of VCL, we introduced extentions by:
1. Reordering the task sequence to mitigate the risk of severe distribution shift.
2. Assigning most similar or most dissimilar classes into task to promote performance.
3. The addition of scaling factors to strike a better balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining previous information.
